The Charting Library consists of a charting component that you should host on your server, and a set of APIs. Flexible design lets you quickly and easily create a charting solution with your own data - which can be in real-time or refresh-only. 

This solution is best for companies of any size that want to get top-notch HTML5 charting onto the corporate site, blog or portal as soon as possible, and for free. 

TradingView Charting Library allows you to implement your own high-end charting solution in a few steps.

* Download your [[copy of Charting Library|Package-Content]] and then [[run it|Running-Your-Charting-Library]].
* [[Decide how to provide the data for charts|Choosing-Data-Transport]].
* Implement your own data source solution or use an existing one. [[Want samples|Choosing-Data-Transport#want-examples-]]?

After step 3 you will have a complete and working charting tool. If you want your charts to have a custom appearance, then you may go further.
