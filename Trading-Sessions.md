The Charting Library expects to receive trading sessions descriptor in Symbol Info. Session is a time range when trades may appear. Each session should be assigned with left and right bounds. In the Charting Library, session time format is “HHMM-HHMM”. E.g., session starting at 9:30am and ending at 16:00 pm should look like “0930-1600”. There is a special case for symbols traded 24x7 (e.g., Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies): the session string then should be "24x7". Session time is expected to be in exchange time zone.

If session left border is greater than the right one (ie, 1700-0900), this session is treated as an overnight one. Overnight session is always started in previous day: e.g., if the symbol is traded Monday-Friday 1700-0900, the first session on week (#i) will be treated as started in Sunday 17:00 of previous week (#i-1) and ending at 09:00 on Monday of this week (#i).

There may be more than one session per trading day. If you have some, you should assign the whole day session as a sessions set separated with comma. E.g., supposing the day have trades open from 9:30 to 14:00 and then from 14:30 to 17:00, the day session string should be "0930-1400,1430-1700".

Also, there may be a situation when trading hours differ from day to day. You can use the `:` specifier to assign the day the session should be applied to. E.g., if the symbol has 0900-1630 all days but the Monday (in Monday, the trades are 0900-1400), the session string should be "0900-1630|0900-1400:2". Let's see this string in details.


Fragment | Meaning
---------|--------
0900-1630|A session 0900-1630. It's the default session for all days because it's not followed by `:` specifier.
\||Sessions separator. This character divides different sessions descriptors.
0900-1400|A session 0900-1400. It's the session for a day #2 (see below)
:|Day specifier. This character follows the session hours description and is followed by day number.
2|The day number for the session above (0900-1400)


Days numbers are 1 for Sunday and 7 for Saturday (2 -- Monday, 3 -- Tuesday, e.t.c.). It's possible to override more than one day with a single session record. E.g., in "0900-1630|0900-1400:23" 0900-1400 sessions will be assigned to days #2 and #3 (Monday, Tuesday).

**version: 1.1**:

One can specify the first trading day of a week using semicolon. Examples:
```
"1;0900-1630|0900-1400:2" : first day of week is Sunday
"0900-1630|0900-1400:2;6" : first day of week is Saturday
"0900-1630|0900-1400:2"   : first day of week is Monday (default value)
```
