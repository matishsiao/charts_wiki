Charting Library supports localization and is already translated to a number of languages. All you have to do to change your chart's language is to specify `locale` parameter when creating Library widget.

Our translations are crowd-sourced so everyone can participate. Visit [our page on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tradingview/) to take a part. Please read our "[Getting Started with TradingView translation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NEQzkMLzOZmk0CeZoOyX4wM8eer0moVEEwRvpG3wqdA/edit)" guide before.
