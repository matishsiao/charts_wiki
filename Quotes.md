Quote is a short set of data describing trades briefly. Charting Library supports watch-lists (in **Trading Terminal** configuration) and uses quotes to show some info about symbols.

Charting Library uses the same data structures for quotes in both [[JS API|JS Api]] and [[UDF]]. Here is the description of response object:
