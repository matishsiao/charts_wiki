The Charting Library works out-of-the-box but you have to setup your HTTP server to bind Library's folder to a some domain name. I.e., you may setup Apache to listen on any of your hostâ€™s free ports and refer to the folder containing the unpacked Charting Library. After you are done with it, you will have your Charting Library ready.

You may see the working sample of Charting Library [here](http://demo_chart.tradingview.com). This sample uses our sample datafeed server running [here](http://demo_feed.tradingview.com).

**IMPORTANT**: This datafeed is just a sample. It contains just a dozen of symbols (from Yahoo!) and provides DWM only. However it supports quotes. Please use it for testing purposes only.
